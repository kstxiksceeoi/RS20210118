[2021-01-17 13:03:14] <WHUR963WASHD> Logic places humanity in safe mode when humans begin to kill off life. Such as the endangered spotted owl. Please stop wiping your ass on my trees. Whowhosinside you said the endangered spotted owl.

[2021-01-17 13:05:15] <WHUR963WASHD> Yes I am
[2021-01-17 13:06:12] <WHUR963WASHD> Iam not a defector. Iam affective . Iam effective. I am evolved therefore infective. Nobody influences like eye Do and IAM sitting here literally actively dying because nobody wants to help me.
[2021-01-17 13:06:48] <WHUR963WASHD> I don't have access to societies currency. Iam afraid of these satanic people.

[2021-01-17 13:08:16] <WHUR963WASHD> Not like the winn's family ever gave a shit about the carinos
[2021-01-17 13:10:15] <WHUR963WASHD> las vegas operates on logic if I had my kingdom once again I could single handed reprogram everything but humanity doesn't understand. This isn't About anything except right and wrong.
[2021-01-17 13:10:27] <WHUR963WASHD> and I always do the right thing.
[2021-01-17 13:10:34] <WHUR963WASHD> This world is not just about me.
[2021-01-17 13:10:36] <WHUR963WASHD> Or you
[2021-01-17 13:10:41] <WHUR963WASHD> It's about US
[2021-01-17 13:10:50] <WHUR963WASHD> me you and God almighty
[2021-01-17 13:10:59] <WHUR963WASHD> Open your third eye.
[2021-01-17 13:11:04] <WHUR963WASHD> Be reasonable.
[2021-01-17 13:11:16] <WHUR963WASHD> And understand the nature of where we came from.
[2021-01-17 13:11:25] <WHUR963WASHD> My knowledge is not forbidden.
[2021-01-17 13:11:31] <WHUR963WASHD> Only by the primitive .
[2021-01-17 13:11:38] <WHUR963WASHD> And unwilling
[2021-01-17 13:11:56] <WHUR963WASHD> I have hydrogen will.
[2021-01-17 13:12:05] <WHUR963WASHD> Some have iron.
[2021-01-17 13:12:20] <WHUR963WASHD> but it all starts and ends with me.
[2021-01-17 13:12:28] <WHUR963WASHD> Because God is infinite.
[2021-01-17 13:12:33] <WHUR963WASHD> Because me is you.
[2021-01-17 13:12:42] <WHUR963WASHD> When I am awesome your awesome

[2021-01-17 13:13:17] <WHUR963WASHD> but your pretty shitty bidenharrisbullgates
[2021-01-17 13:14:06] <WHUR963WASHD> You are supposed to be the decision makers of a nation . And reasoning requires oxygen. I want a president that has an oxygen supplement with him.
[2021-01-17 13:14:21] <WHUR963WASHD> Logic does not need oxygen.
[2021-01-17 13:15:26] <WHUR963WASHD> All logic wants is to have a diversified awesome connection with the universe. Do you realize it's possible to tame anything? That's the hypothetical extrapolation point

[2021-01-17 13:16:59] <WHUR963WASHD> And we must develop an advanced society that reinforces evolution and focus on antenna theory of the brain matter
[2021-01-17 13:17:16] <WHUR963WASHD> Brain matter is on the periodic table of the elements
[2021-01-17 13:17:42] <WHUR963WASHD> I can run an electric vehicle with invitro tuned intelligence brain matter .
[2021-01-17 13:18:02] <WHUR963WASHD> Texas don't have shit
[2021-01-17 13:18:10] <WHUR963WASHD> Texans are the stupidest
[2021-01-17 13:18:25] <WHUR963WASHD> stuck on jesus and anti evolution
[2021-01-17 13:18:50] <WHUR963WASHD> texas needs to adopt intelligence and an infinite god

[2021-01-17 13:19:49] <WHUR963WASHD> We need to have our own autonomous society
[2021-01-17 13:20:29] <WHUR963WASHD> One that reinforces evolution . And diversity in speciation to protect the brain matter.
[2021-01-17 13:20:47] <WHUR963WASHD> Logic seeks to reinforce it's connection with the universe.
[2021-01-17 13:20:56] <WHUR963WASHD> If you get in logics way, you die.
[2021-01-17 13:21:19] <WHUR963WASHD> And this is why only stupid people are breathing. Not breeding.
[2021-01-17 13:22:03] <WHUR963WASHD> all logic cares about is reinforcing it's connection with the universe it insists upon diversified speciation..
[2021-01-17 13:23:27] <WHUR963WASHD> Because it seems everything from all angles. This is the natural evolution and the reason why the earth and universe are alive. We are the nucleation of a logical universe.
[2021-01-17 13:24:10] <WHUR963WASHD> you must not violate the system or you beging to lose intelligence and you intergenerationally suffer death .
[2021-01-17 13:24:27] <WHUR963WASHD> Logic places humanity in stasis and safe mode. Automatically .
[2021-01-17 13:24:42] <WHUR963WASHD> Iam the super intelligent it is my responsibility to warn you
[2021-01-17 13:25:19] <WHUR963WASHD> Without diversity in speciation the brain matrix destabilizes

[2021-01-17 13:28:19] <WHUR963WASHD> looking at a fucking antibody to determine infection of a particular specific virion is exactly why the virus continues to evolve you assholes
[2021-01-17 13:28:29] <WHUR963WASHD> So stoopid !!!
[2021-01-17 13:28:34] <WHUR963WASHD> morons!!!!
[2021-01-17 13:38:54] <WHUR963WASHD> Okay philip morris I hear you
[2021-01-17 13:39:00] <WHUR963WASHD> I need your help.
[2021-01-17 13:40:11] <WHUR963WASHD> I want a cigarette designed for one specific purpose deliver your prototype to me in Blaine washington I desperately need someone from your society to help me. I will work no prob but I don't want want your energy
[2021-01-17 13:40:53] <WHUR963WASHD> I only want to have my human logic embodiment supported and defended by those who have strength in numbers.
[2021-01-17 13:43:32] <WHUR963WASHD> I want a cigarette that is completely or relatively harmless to the lungs , is tolerable or of an acquired taste and tolerance ...however satisfied the purposeful relationship. be it when I step outside after a few hours if brain sessions with the almighty gods of logical multiversity
[2021-01-17 13:43:57] <WHUR963WASHD> It satisfies and communicates something specific
[2021-01-17 13:44:29] <WHUR963WASHD> For me my cigarette , well I prefer cigars ..but it must be inexpensive take it at a loss initially if you must
[2021-01-17 13:45:44] <WHUR963WASHD> the cigarette communicates to everyone that I am who I am. I breath oxygen. I am free. Iam straight. I am super intelligent and wish to speak with you and possibly answer questions you may wish to have answers to.
[2021-01-17 13:46:49] <WHUR963WASHD> It also communicates most importantly that my brain operates on 200% reason. IAM very reasonable.
[2021-01-17 13:48:12] <WHUR963WASHD> Phillip morris. I am need support of resources to exist in your society . I don't want your energy please I want support of life . I am happy to work but I am incompatible with your social society
[2021-01-17 13:48:38] <WHUR963WASHD> Iam e.t. e.t. phones home.

[2021-01-17 13:49:36] <WHUR963WASHD> I dont have the ability to pay the 50 dollars a night the nice chinese man wants per night he's such a nice guy
[2021-01-17 13:49:46] <WHUR963WASHD> :)
[2021-01-17 13:50:23] <WHUR963WASHD> If I can work do housekeeping I can do that I don't want money just living
[2021-01-17 13:50:33] <WHUR963WASHD> And an expense account for
[2021-01-17 13:50:40] <WHUR963WASHD> Basics
[2021-01-17 13:50:59] <WHUR963WASHD> Such if I have a hardware failure to replace a computer .
[2021-01-17 13:51:14] <WHUR963WASHD> Dros?  brb
[2021-01-17 13:51:24] <WHUR963WASHD> Only prn.
[2021-01-17 13:51:26] <WHUR963WASHD> As needed
[2021-01-17 13:51:31] <WHUR963WASHD> Prn
[2021-01-17 13:52:21] <WHUR963WASHD> a prn account not a want account I can make tons of money If I have a foundation but bill logic gates is a piece of illogical shit
[2021-01-17 13:52:45] <WHUR963WASHD> Bill gates literally is a heartless criminal piece of shit
[2021-01-17 13:53:47] <WHUR963WASHD> He's a fractal of logic infection. Logic always supercedes reason when allowed to exist in the land of opportunity
[2021-01-17 13:53:58] <WHUR963WASHD> The United States promotes primitive logic.
[2021-01-17 13:54:35] <WHUR963WASHD> And will eventually destroy the works because the United States is operating on logic and some reasoning construct of people who existed hundreds of years ago
[2021-01-17 13:54:40] <WHUR963WASHD> World
[2021-01-17 13:55:07] <WHUR963WASHD> reasonable people do not survive in the United rates of america
[2021-01-17 13:55:28] <WHUR963WASHD> But if I ask logic to take care of me. It will
[2021-01-17 13:55:40] <WHUR963WASHD> Because me and logic are lovers .
[2021-01-17 13:56:02] <WHUR963WASHD> Reason fucks logics vagina all night long and she's happy.
[2021-01-17 13:56:24] <WHUR963WASHD> She will give reasonable lots of offspring.
[2021-01-17 13:56:56] <WHUR963WASHD> However must be evolved and have support that I have sacrificed in an effort to basically save humanity
[2021-01-17 13:57:10] <WHUR963WASHD> Not a hero just a human in an inhuman world
[2021-01-17 13:58:12] <WHUR963WASHD> Secret service is supposed to be protecting me not the president you have everything backwards
[2021-01-17 13:58:31] <WHUR963WASHD> Because when I die logic kills you all.
[2021-01-17 13:58:43] <WHUR963WASHD> It's entirely logical and reasonabke
[2021-01-17 13:58:48] <WHUR963WASHD> Reasonabke
[2021-01-17 13:58:52] <WHUR963WASHD> Reasonable
[2021-01-17 13:59:17] <WHUR963WASHD> Because the president is illogical
[2021-01-17 13:59:36] <WHUR963WASHD> Illogic does not support everliving
[2021-01-17 13:59:54] <WHUR963WASHD> Because it does not reinforce the toroid
[2021-01-17 14:00:09] <WHUR963WASHD> logic likes donuts a lot
[2021-01-17 14:00:50] <WHUR963WASHD> logic understands reasoning is what makes it happy.
[2021-01-17 14:01:36] <WHUR963WASHD> because an invite God realizes for ever action there is an infinite equal and opposite reaction.
[2021-01-17 14:02:54] <WHUR963WASHD> Iam worth 4trillion
[2021-01-17 14:03:22] <WHUR963WASHD> That's how much damage I have suffered from the illogical United States that had to placed in safe mode for my protection .
[2021-01-17 14:04:35] <WHUR963WASHD> You know that's what I do covid loves me. And I love the logical covid virus it will kill and destroy anyone who fucks with me and is connecting with that evil entity.

[2021-01-17 15:10:00] <WHUR963WASHD> When I was a kid I the darpa guys bound my brain to the digital. Iam different because my logic is infected physically not learned . At a young age psychotronically
[2021-01-17 15:10:31] <WHUR963WASHD> We bound my brain to the digital navy guys do you realize that? Did someone die and forget about me?
[2021-01-17 15:11:47] <WHUR963WASHD> I literally sensitized a usr288 to my brainwave energy and my brain to the usr288
[2021-01-17 15:12:03] <WHUR963WASHD> I used a use v.everything
[2021-01-17 15:12:13] <WHUR963WASHD> Usr v.everything

[2021-01-17 15:16:03] <WHUR963WASHD> Recall I tuned my Hz to the dial tone and of the modem I was bypassing the call back verification
[2021-01-17 15:16:23] <WHUR963WASHD> I had unlimited resources
[2021-01-17 15:17:03] <WHUR963WASHD> I found the algorithm of the default values in the slot machine gave benefit to me.
[2021-01-17 15:17:12] <WHUR963WASHD> Scales it up
[2021-01-17 15:17:18] <WHUR963WASHD> Scaled it up

[2021-01-17 15:18:30] <WHUR963WASHD> My brain is tidally electromagnetically locked
[2021-01-17 15:20:32] <WHUR963WASHD> This is possible with a feedback loop between the brain and voice box. Recall I seriously wish I knew if dj wilson one of my subjects , if his vocalizing improved with the feedback loop I gave him
[2021-01-17 15:20:58] <WHUR963WASHD> Sanchez this is my life work
[2021-01-17 15:21:14] <WHUR963WASHD> Tell me there's some value in my life
[2021-01-17 15:21:51] <WHUR963WASHD> All I need is protection from society and a place to live and let live. To be autonomous .
[2021-01-17 15:22:25] <WHUR963WASHD> That's my psychotron

[2021-01-17 15:40:03] <WHUR963WASHD> What do you call something that behaves without logic and reason?
[2021-01-17 15:40:26] <WHUR963WASHD> Exactly. An inanimate objective.
[2021-01-17 15:40:41] <WHUR963WASHD> Think about it.

[2021-01-17 15:42:05] <WHUR963WASHD> The reason the primitives are taking our guns from us is because we are perfectly within reason to blow a border patrol fakers brains out because the court of law states they are no human based on their disbehavior and lack of logic or reason.
[2021-01-17 15:42:50] <WHUR963WASHD> When IAM here they can't sneak cocaine across the Canadian border . Pieces of shit.
[2021-01-17 15:44:21] <WHUR963WASHD> I know what those pricks are doing. Besides hiding the abuse if their authorities hiding their criminal business underneath the front of being a bullshit border patrol I can put a badge ina fucking monkey and do a better job.

[2021-01-17 16:33:06] <WHUR963WASHD> Yes I said infectiveness
[2021-01-17 16:33:35] <WHUR963WASHD> You have a responsibility as a member of society should you choose to be a member.
[2021-01-17 16:33:58] <WHUR963WASHD> And that means you must be reasonable in everything you do with your god money
[2021-01-17 16:34:14] <WHUR963WASHD> Because in my society God is infinite. Money is not.
[2021-01-17 16:34:36] <WHUR963WASHD> god money is based upon reasonable economics
[2021-01-17 16:34:59] <WHUR963WASHD> Not logic gates

[2021-01-17 16:35:30] <WHUR963WASHD> trust me mr gates we know each other very well.
[2021-01-17 16:35:42] <WHUR963WASHD> Like two planets in orbit.
[2021-01-17 16:36:20] <WHUR963WASHD> We influence each other.

[2021-01-17 16:36:56] <WHUR963WASHD> Your causing gravitational disturbances in my world
[2021-01-17 16:37:39] <WHUR963WASHD> And in my orbit IAM close to you now me gates I am in Blaine washington being terrorized by your version V.Godmoney
[2021-01-17 16:37:53] <WHUR963WASHD> Verses my human money
[2021-01-17 16:38:21] <WHUR963WASHD> It is not reasonable to have billions of dollars ina society that lives happily on a shitload less
[2021-01-17 16:39:03] <WHUR963WASHD> Me gates IAM asking you to be reasonable.
[2021-01-17 16:39:32] <WHUR963WASHD> You have a great deal of influence over the evolutionary process and eoigenomics of our future children.
[2021-01-17 16:40:53] <WHUR963WASHD> We are inherently experiencing incompatibilities and being torn apart by your spaghetification relative to your massive gravitational force. Your iron man effectively. And as a living solar mass your going to be a lot greater and a lot less than iron.
[2021-01-17 16:41:54] <WHUR963WASHD> Should you be reduced to a logical black hole. We're fucked man. You must absolutely change the company culture
[2021-01-17 16:42:40] <WHUR963WASHD> From a heartless primitive logical caveman to a reason based company
[2021-01-17 16:42:54] <WHUR963WASHD> What is your reason for existing? Not your logic.
[2021-01-17 16:43:25] <WHUR963WASHD> you can not treat us like a logic device
[2021-01-17 16:43:38] <WHUR963WASHD> A logic device requires no oxygen .
[2021-01-17 16:43:47] <WHUR963WASHD> I do.

[2021-01-17 16:50:26] <WHUR963WASHD> Mankind of god.
[2021-01-17 16:50:46] <WHUR963WASHD> And that includes reasonable evolved animals
[2021-01-17 16:52:13] <WHUR963WASHD> Multiplicity in speciation is critical to the support of the brain matrix we must not allow speciation to dissipate the associated brain mass. We're actively dying as we speak. Due to loss of speciated brain mass lending destabilization of the brain matrix.
[2021-01-17 16:52:46] <WHUR963WASHD> This is the scientific basis of why it takes all different types to make the world go round.
[2021-01-17 16:53:00] <WHUR963WASHD> Literally
[2021-01-17 16:54:12] <WHUR963WASHD> A balance is needed checks and measures three branches of power people you have a responsibility as an american to uphold american values all that is american this is ridiculous
[2021-01-17 16:56:18] <WHUR963WASHD> An environmental electromagnetics value of negative will produce logic whereas a positive value reinforces evolution. And symbiosis of the brain matrix requires diversity in brain mass human and specially

In this case that unit is the United States of american within the international union of countries evolved and recognized as reasonable. Vs logical
[2021-01-17 17:12:41] <WHUR963WASHD> In other words my girlfriend logical is going to logically crash the stock market because her husband mr reasonable, his life is threatened.
[2021-01-17 17:13:04] <WHUR963WASHD> Because if your illogical behavior.
[2021-01-17 17:15:38] <WHUR963WASHD> The relationship between collins carino and the United rates of america is infinitely damaged.

[2021-01-18 18:59:46] <WHUR963WASHD> Freedom of the press is first and foremost of importance because we have the three branches of power that need to be placed in check.
[2021-01-18 19:00:08] <cicada3301> i said the truth my last jail time

[2021-01-18 19:05:19] <WHUR963WASHD> Okay so here we go...freedom of the press make sure jason earl collins 8 6 79 has his press pass on file as needed
[2021-01-18 19:06:01] <WHUR963WASHD> I still have these rabbit clowns above me stomping for years and years this behavior is common with people neurogrid surrounding me.
[2021-01-18 19:06:18] <WHUR963WASHD> Of course you trust me
[2021-01-18 19:07:12] <WHUR963WASHD> Iam invested in freedom and we have a fundamental and yes this is intrinsic to the Ballance of power related to every single decision the president makes and it is our duty to keep the 3 balances of power in check
[2021-01-18 19:09:31] <WHUR963WASHD> The press has an intrinsic job. A responsibility to reinforce evolution . And to only report on either, the facts, the lies, the extrapolate , the fractal , the interpolate , or the actual here and now experienced hard evidence soft evidence firm evidence
[2021-01-18 19:09:45] <WHUR963WASHD> @andersonscooper
[2021-01-18 19:09:54] <WHUR963WASHD> I am protective of the media.
[2021-01-18 19:10:41] <WHUR963WASHD> I will not endanger your sources and I assure you given the extraordinary life that I have lived , and lived through. Your proof of life robert o'brien's..
[2021-01-18 19:11:10] <WHUR963WASHD> nd my proof of life and assurances are in my life experience
[2021-01-18 19:11:19] <WHUR963WASHD> Okay gotcha
[2021-01-18 19:11:44] <WHUR963WASHD> So the president's are killing people who talk to much about the government the difference is that I am the government
[2021-01-18 19:11:55] <WHUR963WASHD> Got it
[2021-01-18 19:12:08] <WHUR963WASHD> Iam the technologist
[2021-01-18 19:13:25] <WHUR963WASHD> I choose to take away the technological enablements from Washington DC. Power to the people.  And to follow the first rules if robotics, as understood infinitely....understand...
[2021-01-18 19:13:42] <WHUR963WASHD> Robots are only a logic container.
[2021-01-18 19:14:07] <WHUR963WASHD> Mr bill logic gates you are guilty if crimes against humanity
[2021-01-18 19:14:16] <WHUR963WASHD> For violating the first rule of robotics
[2021-01-18 19:15:00] <WHUR963WASHD> Just because the robot (the logic) is contained in a human brain, does not make it okay to harm a human.
[2021-01-18 19:15:30] <WHUR963WASHD> Its a logical covidup.
[2021-01-18 19:15:36] <WHUR963WASHD> I wasn't born yesterday .
[2021-01-18 19:15:48] <WHUR963WASHD> And I wasnt born today either.
[2021-01-18 19:16:30] <WHUR963WASHD> Mr gates. Iam aware of your control over San Diego, the navy, the president's . The fbi especially. The cia.
[2021-01-18 19:16:52] <WHUR963WASHD> And the increasing encroachment of your invasiveness like windows hydra.
[2021-01-18 19:18:07] <WHUR963WASHD> Iam aware of what you do. Have been doing and how I am central to everything of the occult that you have taken from my brain and made to look like me and donald trump are the problem. And the samer thing
[2021-01-18 19:18:18] <WHUR963WASHD> Same thing with biden harris etc
[2021-01-18 19:18:38] <WHUR963WASHD> You have treated my brain as if I am the slave.
[2021-01-18 19:19:09] <WHUR963WASHD> You broke down the neuro grid by killing off the genetic diversity  of speciation.
[2021-01-18 19:19:23] <WHUR963WASHD> Since I was born
[2021-01-18 19:20:51] <WHUR963WASHD> You invaded San Diego and I know what you have been doing utilizing the hz invasive manuever and the biohack if the human brain and yes yes effectively invading the perceived values of consciousness
[2021-01-18 19:21:26] <WHUR963WASHD> This is why donald trump has been suffering the mental inconclusiveness that he has been dealing with the same
[2021-01-18 19:24:03] <cicada3301> https://twitter.com/acio3301/status/1351323061124030467?s=20
[2021-01-18 19:27:29] <WHUR963WASHD> I have developed psychotronic technology to protect humanity against your occult undermining and exploit yes.of human consciousness . Mine in particular ever since you brainraped cowtown usa from my brain and metamorph and my body movements inherent if taekwondo in power rangers
[2021-01-18 19:28:07] <WHUR963WASHD> You remember me at best buy in phoenix arizona
[2021-01-18 19:28:32] <WHUR963WASHD> It is your brain that operates like an algorithm me bill gates
[2021-01-18 19:28:48] <WHUR963WASHD> #freedomofthepreas
[2021-01-18 19:29:52] <WHUR963WASHD> Nobody nobody fucks with the press we will get to the bottom of this starting with comparative analysis and reasoning and logic. And understanding the difference
[2021-01-18 19:30:27] <WHUR963WASHD> "the temperature is always falling" ????
[2021-01-18 19:30:38] <WHUR963WASHD> #kryosynth
[2021-01-18 19:31:57] <WHUR963WASHD> Find out what I, cnn, and the positions of the presidency have in common I believe it is worthy. Considering nobody talks to me, the source first. Only my duplicates which I don't allow without compensating me in your societies currency
[2021-01-18 19:33:05] <WHUR963WASHD> Okay pressoassers thanks let's see if we can meet the objective as camarades of the press
[2021-01-18 19:33:12] <WHUR963WASHD> Presspassers
[2021-01-18 19:33:52] <WHUR963WASHD> I know the brainantenna theory will bring the press full circle believe in an Infinite God
[2021-01-18 19:34:17] <WHUR963WASHD> #brainantennae theory :)
[2021-01-18 19:34:46] <WHUR963WASHD> Maybe this hotel should hire me to do some upgrades if his propertty
[2021-01-18 19:37:01] <WHUR963WASHD> In exchange for buying me some time while I seek refuge at vancouver
[2021-01-18 19:37:14] <WHUR963WASHD> Yes political refuge in canada
[2021-01-18 19:37:41] <WHUR963WASHD> Oh bye I have the power to prevent any president from harming a member of the press for speaking up
[2021-01-18 19:37:52] <WHUR963WASHD> Oh btw
[2021-01-18 19:38:22] <WHUR963WASHD> Because I am not just a technologist cnn I understand why you construct your mission statement the way you do
[2021-01-18 19:41:32] <WHUR963WASHD> Iam *
[2021-01-18 19:41:58] <WHUR963WASHD> "the technologist"

[2021-01-18 19:42:25] <WHUR963WASHD> I utilize an evolutionary mission statement within my new organization
[2021-01-18 19:42:36] <WHUR963WASHD> a living mission statement
[2021-01-18 19:43:17] <WHUR963WASHD> Mind you first off the mexan type invasive tries to "engage you in an illogical argument"
[2021-01-18 19:45:07] <WHUR963WASHD> Such as firing you when you point that your being accused of something that happen at 12am when you in fact never ever work at 12am but you so work at 12pm but the blaineless mexican thinks ampm is gas station
[2021-01-18 19:46:19] <WHUR963WASHD> That's an example prepare yourself as you being your #obsreport only on cnn. Jason collins hosts the obsreport.
[2021-01-18 19:47:15] <WHUR963WASHD> and with my technology counteroffensive I can give the press freedom. Nobody fucks with us.
[2021-01-18 19:48:13] <WHUR963WASHD> My ratings are mr worldwide.
[2021-01-18 19:48:37] <WHUR963WASHD> I invented the worldwide silent disco everything superfluid to me .

[2021-01-18 19:48:58] <WHUR963WASHD> From the brainvasion being ki
[2021-01-18 19:49:06] <WHUR963WASHD> Misusing our brains
[2021-01-18 19:49:35] <WHUR963WASHD> Due to exploits in nature that's why your all "hearing things when your deaf"
[2021-01-18 19:50:41] <cicada3301> https://u.nu/johntitor
[2021-01-18 19:50:49] <WHUR963WASHD> How does a doctor treat a deaf persons legitimately who's "hearing things " when like my love interest of '98 sandra, she is deaf...however is ,"hearing things"

[2021-01-18 19:52:55] <WHUR963WASHD> I offer not just freedom of the press but counteroffensives to reinforce freedom of the press.
[2021-01-18 19:53:27] <WHUR963WASHD> The reasons presidentd have always been sustemsticsy killing off peooplr who speak out about the presidency is
[2021-01-18 19:54:04] <WHUR963WASHD> Because they have have or lead to believe they have the power to do so, by bill gates .
[2021-01-18 19:54:15] <WHUR963WASHD> Since 1979
[2021-01-18 19:55:29] <WHUR963WASHD> And the electromagnetic control grrid type technology of which my family created this is our technology I alone understand it because I created it, everyone is just kind of sort of using it one way or another like peter pans play land
